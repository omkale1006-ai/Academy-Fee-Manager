# 🎓 Academy Fee Manager

## 📌 Project Description
Academy Fee Manager is a **Python-based fee management system** built using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)**.  
It helps in managing **student admission details, fee installments, pending fees, and summary reports** in a simple **menu-driven system**.  

This project demonstrates the use of:
- ✅ Inheritance
- ✅ Encapsulation
- ✅ Dunder Methods (`__str__`, `__len__`, `__del__`)
- ✅ Destructor

- 📑 **View Student Details** – Display student info neatly using `__str__`  
- 🔢 **Count Installments** – Using `__len__` method  
- 🗑 **Delete Student Record** – Destructor shows message when record is deleted
